  <b>Sign Language</b>

  Type /{0}, navigate the menu, and choose your sign language.


  Set sign language by typing it's code as a command. For example, for American Sign Language, type /ase or /ASL.


  You can also configure up to 3 sign languages. If a verse is not available in the primary sign language, I will
  look for it in the next one. Type


  <code>/{0} csg lsc asl</code>



  <b>Bible Passages</b>

  You can request up to 5 Bible passages in a single message. Use the full name of the book or its abbreviation.


  You can also temporarily change your sign language. Write it's code followed by the Bible passage. For example:


  <code>/ase 1 Tim 2:6</code>

  <code>/hab 1 Tim 2:6</code>


  <b>Bot Language</b>

  I can speak to you in several languages. Click on /{1} and select one. If you know the code, use it directly.
  For example, for English, you can write /en or /E.


  Even if you choose a language that I don't know yet, I will be able to understand you when you request Bible passages
  in your language. I will also try to send you the written text of the Bible passages in your language.
  If you want to help translate the bot into more languages, leave me a /{2} and <a href="{3}">start translating</a>.


  <b>Inline Mode</b>

  Write <code>{4}</code> in any Telegram chat to send Bible passages.


# {} -> overlay command
overlay_info: >
  <b>Text Overlay</b>

  When you activate /{}, you will see the Bible passage in your language. Technically, you can use any combination of
  languages available on the <a href="https://www.jw.org">JW</a> website.


  If the book is written the same way in both your <i>written language</i> and your <i>sign language</i>,
  you won't see the text overlay.


overlay_activated: You have <b>activated</b> the text overlay.
overlay_deactivated: You have <b>deactivated</b> the text overlay.
